## Project Description
The "Ultrasound Densitometry" project is an initiative to develop a safe and non-ionising bone density measurement method using ultrasonic spectroscopy and machine learning.

### Background
Bone density measurement is an important component in osteoporosis diagnosis and bone health monitoring. However, current standard methods, such as Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA), involve exposure to ionising radiation, which has potential risks for patients. 

This project aims to address such issues by developing a safer method of measuring bone density using spectroscopy.
